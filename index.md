## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

* Lab 7, part 1

  My favorite was lab 7 because it was mostly about loops and if statements. I had fun looking at the conditions on when we were able to park and depending where too. It was tricky on the part that we had to write the conditions, not because they were hard, but because it was confusing with all the ors(||) and ands(&&) and trying to see where the grouping would begin and finish. 

* Lab 5, part 1

  This lab was also my favorite because we worked with Cin and also Cout. Since we were barely starting to learn new statements I was more comfortable with this lab since it had a lot of integer variables to declare. I was also comfortable using the symbols of multiplication when needing to multiply and display the product.     

* Lab 6, part 1

  I liked this lab because we worked with the command line and also had to work with if statements. I was confused at first because I had entered the wrong size since I did not count the running command “./”. I also really liked how we used the cout statement to print out what we had inputted and how a sentence was created.
